# Horizon

Horizon is a beautifully warm dark colorscheme for Vim & inspired by [Visual Studio Code Horizon Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jolaleye.horizon-theme-vscode)

## Installation

* Use [Vim Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

```
Plug 'ntk148v/vim-horizon'
```

* Other Vim Plugin Management Tools should be the same.

## Compatibility

I only tested vim-horizon with Neovim, but it might work with Vim as well.
